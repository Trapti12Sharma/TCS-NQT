A supermarket maintains a pricing format for all its products.
A value N is printed on each product. When the scanner reads the value N on the item, the product of all the digits in the value N is the price of the item.
The task here is to design the software such that given the code of any item N the product (multiplication) of all the digits of value should be computed(price).
SOLUTION
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
  int mul(int n){
      int m=1;
      while(n!=0){
         int rem=n%10;
         m= m*rem;
         n=n/10;
                
      }
      return m;
  }
  
  
  
int main(){
    int n;
    cin>>n;
    int ans;
    
     ans=mul(n);
    
   cout<<ans;
}
