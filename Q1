Given an integer array Arr of size N the task is to find the count of elements whose value is greater than all of its prior elements.

Note : 1st element of the array should be considered in the count of the result.

For example,

Arr[]={7,4,8,2,9}

As 7 is the first element, it will consider in the result.

8 and 9 are also the elements that are greater than all of its previous elements.

Since total of  3 elements is present in the array that meets the condition.

Hence the output = 3.

SOLUTION
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int check(vector<int> arr,int n){
    int c=1;
    for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
        if(arr[0]<arr[i])
        c++;
    }
    return c;
    
}
int main(){
    int n;
    cin>>n;
  vector<int>arr;
   int ans=0;
   int input;
    
    for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
        cin>>input;
        arr.push_back(input);
    }
    ans=check(arr,n);
    cout<<ans;
}
